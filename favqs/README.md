Other services require users to be signed into their accounts to ba able to like quotes. vote on quotes, edit quotes and even delete quotes. All of the api endpoints are very easy to use and have descriptive names.

This application requires that users generate unique tokens which will allow them login into the system and consume the endpoints with ease. More on this topic later.
